/**
 * A Comprehensive Guide to Differences Between TypeScript and JavaScript
 */

/**
 * 1. Introduction to TypeScript vs JavaScript
 * Definition: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, adding static typing and advanced features.
 * Logic: JavaScript runs directly in browsers; TypeScript compiles to JavaScript for execution.
 * Reason: TypeScript addresses JavaScript’s limitations for large-scale, enterprise-level apps.
 * Use Case: JavaScript for quick scripts, TypeScript for robust, complex projects.
 * Key Points:
 *   - JavaScript: Dynamically typed, flexible
 *   - TypeScript: Static typing, structured
 * Important Note: All JavaScript is valid TypeScript, but TypeScript enhances it.
 */

/**
 * 2. Why TypeScript When We Have JavaScript?
 * Definition: TypeScript was created to overcome JavaScript’s weaknesses in OOP and scalability.
 * Logic: JavaScript’s loose typing and prototype-based nature can complicate large projects.
 * Reason: TypeScript adds type safety and tools for enterprise-grade server-side and client-side code.
 * Use Case: Building maintainable, large-scale web or server applications.
 * Key Points:
 *   - JavaScript: Grew from client-side to server-side
 *   - TypeScript: Designed for reliability and scale
 * Important Note: TypeScript improves code quality where JavaScript struggles.

/**
 * 3. Features of TypeScript
 * Definition: TypeScript extends JavaScript with unique capabilities.
 * Logic: Adds type annotations, compilation, and compatibility for better development.
 * Reason: Enables error catching, flexibility, and integration with existing code.
 * Use Case: Enhancing projects with libraries, cross-platform support, and type safety.
 * Key Points:
 *   - Transpilation: Compiles .ts to .js
 *   - Conversion: .js to .ts by renaming
 *   - Versatility: Runs on any browser/device
 *   - Library Support: Works with JavaScript libraries
 * Important Note: TypeScript bridges JavaScript’s gaps for modern needs.
 */

// Example: TypeScript Compilation
let myString: string = "Hello from TypeScript";
console.log(myString);
// Save as 'file.ts', run `tsc file.ts` to get 'file.js'

/**
 * 4. Difference Between TypeScript and JavaScript
 * Definition: Key distinctions in typing, structure, and usage.
 * Logic: TypeScript enforces types and structure; JavaScript is flexible and simple.
 * Reason: TypeScript suits complex apps; JavaScript fits rapid development.
 * Use Case: TypeScript for teams, JavaScript for small scripts.
 * Key Points:
 *   - Typing: Static (TS) vs. Dynamic (JS)
 *   - Object Orientation: Class-based (TS) vs. Prototype-based (JS)
 *   - Interfaces: Supported (TS) vs. Not supported (JS)
 *   - Tooling: Advanced IDE support (TS) vs. Limited (JS)
 *   - Syntax: JS + extras (TS) vs. Standard JS
 *   - Compatibility: TS runs JS; JS can’t run TS
 *   - Debugging: Compile-time (TS) vs. Runtime (JS)
 *   - Learning Curve: Steeper (TS) vs. Familiar (JS)
 * Important Note: TypeScript builds on JavaScript for better control.

// Example: Type Safety
let value: number = 10;
// value = "ten"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
console.log(value);

/**
 * 5. When Should You Use TypeScript?
 * Definition: Scenarios where TypeScript excels over JavaScript.
 * Logic: Offers compile-time checks, type definitions, and scalability tools.
 * Reason: Reduces bugs, improves maintenance, and handles complexity.
 * Use Case: Large projects, team collaboration, scalable apps.
 * Key Points:
 *   - Error Prevention: Catches issues before runtime
 *   - Static Typing: Defines types for predictability
 *   - Scalability: Interfaces, enums, generics for big apps
 * Important Note: Ideal for long-term, complex development.
 */

/**
 * 6. When to Stick with JavaScript?
 * Definition: Situations where JavaScript is the better choice.
 * Logic: No compilation, simple syntax, and quick to use.
 * Reason: Faster for small tasks, no learning curve for JS devs.
 * Use Case: Small projects, quick prototypes, simple scripts.
 * Key Points:
 *   - Simplicity and Speed: No compile step, less code
 *   - Familiarity: Easy for JS-experienced devs
 * Important Note: JavaScript suits rapid, small-scale work.
 */

/**
 * 7. Advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript
 * Definition: Benefits TypeScript provides beyond JavaScript.
 * Logic: Early error detection, strong typing, and modern features.
 * Reason: Improves reliability, design, and browser compatibility.
 * Use Case: Robust apps, team projects, ES6+ integration.
 * Key Points:
 *   - Compile-Time Errors: Spots issues early
 *   - Static Typing: Checks type correctness
 *   - ES6 Support: Compiles to ES3/ES5 for browsers
 * Important Note: TypeScript reduces runtime surprises.
 */

/**
 * 8. Disadvantages of TypeScript over JavaScript
 * Definition: Drawbacks to consider when choosing TypeScript.
 * Logic: Adds steps and complexity compared to JavaScript’s simplicity.
 * Reason: Extra effort for compilation and learning impacts workflow.
 * Use Case: Weigh for small projects or beginner devs.
 * Key Points:
 *   - Compilation Time: Extra step to transpile
 *   - Learning Curve: Time to master features
 * Important Note: JavaScript is quicker for basic tasks.
