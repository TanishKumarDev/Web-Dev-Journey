# TypeScript Type Inference

TypeScript can automatically **deduce the type of a variable, array, function, or object** based on its assigned value or usage context. This is called **type inference**. It reduces the need for explicit type annotations while still keeping your code type-safe.

## 1. Variable Type Inference

```ts
let age = 25;
let name = "John";

console.log(`Age: ${age}`);  // Age: 25
console.log(`Name: ${name}`); // Name: John
```

* TypeScript infers `age` as `number` and `name` as `string`.
* No explicit type declaration needed, but the types are enforced.

---

## 2. Array Type Inference

```ts
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]; // inferred as string[]
console.log(fruits); // [ 'Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry' ]
```

* TypeScript infers `fruits` as `string[]`.
* Adding a number like `fruits.push(10)` will give a **compile-time error**.

---

## 3. Function Return Type Inference

```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
    return a + b; // inferred as number
}

console.log(add(5, 10)); // 15
```

* The return type is automatically inferred as `number`.
* Ensures that the function cannot return a value of a different type.

## âœ… Key Points

1. Type inference makes code **cleaner** and less verbose.
2. The compiler still enforces **type safety**.
3. Useful for simple cases; for more complex data or functions, **explicit annotations** are recommended.
