# Setup

### 1. Installation

**Definition:**
Installation is the process of **adding a software tool or package to your system** so that you can use it.

**Key Points:**

* It’s usually done **once per system**.
* It makes the tool available globally or locally on your machine.
* Examples in TypeScript:

  * Installing **Node.js** (required to run JavaScript/TypeScript)
  * Installing **TypeScript compiler** globally:

    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
  * Verifying installation:

    ```bash
    tsc -v
    ```
* After installation, the software exists on your system, but it is **not yet configured for a specific project**.

**Think of installation as “getting the tool into your toolbox.”**

### 2. Setup (Project Setup)

**Definition:**
Setup is the process of **configuring the installed tools for a specific project** so that you can start writing and running code.

**Key Points:**

* Setup happens **per project**.
* It ensures your project knows how to use the installed tool correctly.
* Examples in TypeScript:

  1. Initialize a Node.js project (creates `package.json`):

     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```
  2. Install TypeScript as a **development dependency** for this project:

     ```bash
     npm install typescript --save-dev
     ```
  3. Create TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`):

     ```bash
     npx tsc --init
     ```
  4. Create your first `.ts` file (`index.ts`) and write code.
  5. Compile and run:

     ```bash
     npx tsc
     node index.js
     ```

**Think of setup as “preparing the toolbox for a specific job/project.”**

### 3. Visual Analogy

| Step         | What Happens                                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Installation | You buy the toolbox (Node.js, TypeScript compiler)                               |
| Setup        | You organize the tools and add instructions (project config, tsconfig, index.ts) |

* You **install once** per machine.
* You **setup every time** you start a new project.

---

So, in your GFG tutorial:

* **Step 1 (Install Node.js)** → installation
* **Step 3 (Install TypeScript in project)** → can be installation too, but project-specific (devDependency)
* **Step 2 (npm init -y), Step 4 (tsconfig.json)** → setup for project
* **Step 5 (write index.ts)** → part of project setup
