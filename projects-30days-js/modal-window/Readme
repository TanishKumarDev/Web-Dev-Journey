# Algo / Breakdown

HTML Structure: 
Include a button to open the modal, a modal container with content and a close button, and an overlay to dim the background.

CSS Styling: 
Use a hidden class to hide the modal and overlay by default. Style the modal for centering and responsiveness.

JavaScript Logic:
    Select DOM elements (open button, close button, modal, overlay).
    Add event listeners to show the modal on open button click and hide it on close button or overlay click.
    Toggle the hidden class to control visibility.
Initialize: Ensure the modal is hidden on page load.
