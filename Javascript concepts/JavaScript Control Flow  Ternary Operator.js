// Ternary Operators

The Ternary Operator in JavaScript is a shortcut for writing simple if-else statements. Itâ€™s also known as the Conditional Operator because it works based on a condition. The ternary operator allows you to quickly decide between two values depending on whether a condition is true or false.
