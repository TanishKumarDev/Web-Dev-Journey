# 🚀 Web Development Mastery: Practice Projects

Welcome to my **Web Dev Mastery** repository!  
This repo is part of my journey to become a skilled full-stack web developer by building real-world projects and learning through hands-on experience.

---

## 📌 What This Repository Is About

This is not just about writing code — it's about **understanding** web development from the ground up. I'm focusing on both frontend (React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and full-stack principles as I grow.

### ✅ Key Highlights

- 🧩 Real, functional mini-projects
- 🛠️ Concepts from HTML, CSS, JS to React & more
- 💡 Focus on fundamentals and practical UI/UX building
- 📁 Clean folder structures and modular code
- 🚀 Deployments with Vercel for every project

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Instead of passively watching tutorials, I’m actively learning by:

- Building small apps & features
- Practicing component-based design
- Understanding React deeply (hooks, state, props)
- Experimenting with UI design using Tailwind CSS
- Preparing for larger **MERN stack** projects
