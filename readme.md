# 🚀 My Web Development Journey

Welcome to my **web-dev-journey** repository!  
This repo is part of my journey to become a skilled full-stack web developer by building real-world projects and learning through hands-on experience.



## 🗂️ What's Inside This Repository?

This repo is a mix of:

📘 Notes & Core Concepts
- Structured notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more

- Visual examples and annotated snippets for deeper understanding

- Real project breakdowns: what, why, how

- Reference material to revise faster and smarter

🛠️ Practice Projects
- Small to mid-size apps built using real-world use cases

- Covers everything from UI fundamentals to full-stack logic

- React + Tailwind + API-based apps, deploying everything live

- Deployed on Netlify, Vercel, or AWS

🧠 Why This Repository Exists
- Rather than just consuming tutorials, I'm learning by building and doing. This repo reflects a hands-on approach where I:
- Build functional mini-projects to apply what I learn
- Practice component-driven design with React
- Deepen my understanding of hooks, state, and props
- Experiment with modern UI development using Tailwind CSS
- Prepare for scalable, real-world applications using the MERN stack
