# 🚀 React Mastery: Practice Projects

Welcome to my React Mastery repository!  
This repo is dedicated to learning React.js the **practical** way — through hands-on coding, small projects, and real-world use cases.

## 📌 What This Repo Contains

- ✅ Mini projects built using **core React concepts**
- ✅ Incremental learning approach — from beginner to advanced
- ✅ Organized codebase with reusable components
- ✅ Clean folder structure and modular development
- ✅ Focus on writing readable, scalable React code

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Most tutorials just explain the "what", not the "why".  
This repository is my **learning-in-public journey** to truly understand React by:
- Practicing real UI features
- Debugging actual errors
- Building confidence in state, props, hooks, events, and components

## 🛠 Projects I'm Working On

| Day | Project                | Concepts Covered                     |
|-----|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1   | Expense Tracker (WIP)  | useState, props, components, forms   |
| 2   | TBA                    | ...                                  |

_(More projects coming soon!)_

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is a **learning-first** repo. You may find:
- Errors, bugs, and debugging attempts
- Code improvements and refactoring as I grow
- Honest mistakes that help me learn better

## 📖 Tech Stack

- React (with Create React App)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML & CSS (Basic styling)
- VS Code as primary editor

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Master React fundamentals (JSX, props, state, hooks)
- Build real, functioning UIs
- Prepare for bigger MERN stack projects
- Gain confidence in debugging & refactoring
